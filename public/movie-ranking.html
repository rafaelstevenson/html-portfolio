<h3>Now You See Me</h3>
<p>
    This movie is so magical. It talks about magic and it actually inspired me how
    illusion and magic tricks are so cool and made me wanting to learn magic tricks last time.

<h3>Sherlock Holmes BBC</h3>
<p>
    I've always liked mystery stories and this movie just gives the perfect mystery
    story by the thrill, good music, and cinematography. Love Sherlock!

<h3>Queen's Gambit</h3>
<p>
    This movie tells about a story of a genius girl that struggles with mentality and
    being a chess genius in the period where chess was only typical for males. Fun
    to watch the main character Beth Harmon as a woman chess genius. Great cinematography
    and soundtrack by the way!
